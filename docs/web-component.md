The Web Component version of Flipnote.js provides a custom `<flipnote-player>` HTML tag that can be used to embed a Flipnote player UI in any webpage. It's inspired by 

<div>
<flipnote-player width="100%" src="/assets/notes/memoA.kwz"></flipnote-player>
</div>

```
<flipnote-player src="./path/to/some/flipnote.ppm"></flipnote-player>
```

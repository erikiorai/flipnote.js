/**
 * ## Flipnote Studio IDs
 * 
 * Flipnote Studio and Flipnote Studio 3D both generate a "unique" ID for the user when they first launch the app.
 * This ID is then saved into any Flipnotes they create, and was also used as their unique identifier when they went online.
 * 
 * In both apps, your Flipnote Studio ID can be found in the settings menu.
 * 
 * This module contains functions for working with those IDs.
